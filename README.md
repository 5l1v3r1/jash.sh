# Just Another SensePost Hacker

For the [SensePost](https://sensepost.com/) 2018 artwork, we ran an internal competition to develop polyglot's (i.e. code that runs in multiple languages) to print out the text "JASH". This is a throw back to the old [Just Another Perl Hacker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_another_Perl_hacker) competitions. Feel free to submit your own idea with a [pull request](https://github.com/sensepost/jash.sh/compare).

### Winning entry

### The Rules

* The primary aim is to submit a polyglot that runs in the most languages with the fewest characters.
  * Differences in major version numbers of languages can count as different languages
* However, polyglots that use novel techniques, or run in esoteric languages are encouraged.
* As are beautiful polyglots i.e. elegant code or pictographic code.

Ian hacked the rules to come up with his "fileless" polyglot. Pass in any executable that reflects the first parameter in either stdout or stderr.
